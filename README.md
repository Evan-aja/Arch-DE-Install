# Arch-DE-Install
ArchLinux Desktop Environment install script

This script was made based on https://gitlab.com/eflinux/arch-basic with some tweaks for those who sometimes has internet connection problem which makes running a single script multiple times impossible (since there are some echo commands)

Run this script after base install.

1. Download the git repository with git clone https://github.com/Evan-aja/Arch-DE-Install.git
2. chmod -R 755 Arch-DE-Install
3. cd Arch-DE-Install
4. cd to which DE you want to install
5. run each script in succession, DO NOT skip any script (./GNOME1.sh and then ./GNOME2.sh and so on)
